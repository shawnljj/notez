#ST2334 Ch04 - Probability
## Sample Space
> * Set of all possible outcomes
> * Coin: S = {H,T}

## Event
> * Any subset of the sample space

## Algebra of Events
### Union
> * Union of two different events

### Intersection
> * Intersection outcome of the events
> * If no intersection, it is said to be ***mutually exclusive.***

##Counting Tools
### Generalized Basic Principle of Counting
### Factorial
> * Number of ways of arranging N items
> * n! = 1 x 2 x 3 x ... x ***n***

### Permutations
> * Ordering matters!
> * To arrange a subset of N objects
> * nPr

### Combinations
> * Ordering does not matter!
> * Treat the sample like sets
> * Number of ways to choose N objects
> * nCr
 
## Interpretations of Probability
### Equally-likely Outcomes
> * Drawing ace from a deck of cards
> * 4/52 = 1/13
> * rolling dice, coins, card (equally likely outcome)
### Frequency Interpretation
> * proportion of time the event will occur in a long run experiment
> * probability will rain tmr. 
### Personal Probability
> * subjective probability.
> * degree of belief may be different from each other

## Axioms of Probability
> 1. 0 <= p(A) <= 1
> 2. p(S) = 1
> 3. p(AuB) = p(A) + p(B)

## Computing Probabilities
> * P(A) = |A|/|S|
